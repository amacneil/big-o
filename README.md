# Complexity

Complexity is a gem which analyse an anonymous function and verify that it follow a specific pattern
in its memory usage or its execution time.

## Requirements

Calculation of memory space is done via `ps`, and therefore, doesn't work on Windows.

This gem has been tested on Mac OS X, using Ruby 1.9.3.

## Usage

Checking if a function has a complexity of O(n) is as simple as this:

    ```ruby
    time_complexity = Complexity::TimeComplexity({
      :fn    => lambda { |n| do_something_time_consuming(n) },
      :level => lambda { |n| n }
    })
    time_complexity.process # => true if it is growing in time constantly.
    ```

It is also possible to define multiple configuration parameters:

    ```ruby
    space_complexity = Complexity::SpaceComplexity({
      :fn => lambda { |n| do_something_time_consuming(n) }
      :level => lambda { |n| n },
      :range => 1..20,                # value of n
      :timeout => 10,                 # time in seconds
      :approximation => 0.05,         # percentage
      :error_pct => 0.05,             # percentage
      :minimum_result_set_size => 3   # minimum results
    })
    ```
